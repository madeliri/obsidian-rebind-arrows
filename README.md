# Obsidian rebind-arrows plugin

Simple plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) for remap arrows keys to select elements using `Ctrl+J` and `Ctrl+K` in dropdown popups (like autocomplitions) and prompt-inputs (like Command-Pallete or Quick Switcher)

Writing with no experience in typescript.
