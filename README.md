# Obsidian rebind-arrows plugin

Simple [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin for selecting elements in dropdown popups (like autocomplete menu) and prompt-inputs (like Command-Pallete or Quick Switcher) using `Ctrl+J` and `Ctrl+K` (instead of `ArrowDown` and `ArrowUp`)

Writing with no experience in typescript.
